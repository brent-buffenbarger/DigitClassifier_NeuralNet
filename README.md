# Digit Classifier - Neural Net

## Overview
For this project I created the `hello world` of neural networks - an AI that can classify handwritten numbers. This project was done for a homework assignment in my Foundations of Artificial Intelligence course.

## Restrictions
For this project I was not allowed to use any sort of machine learning library such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Numerical libraries such as NumPy were allowed.

## Dataset

## Program Specifics
The overall structure of the neural net used for this project can be seen below:
